Analytics Portfolio

**Approach.**
 1. Import
    LegoSets Data provided by Maven Analytics, was imported to Power Bi and transformed to enable Data cleaning in Power Query.

 2. Data Cleaning
    The data set was explored using power query and, advanced cleaning such as filtering, sorting and new queries and columns were added.

 3. Visualization with Power BI
    a. The Cleaned was applied and saved.

    b. A first page detailing the sales and revenue projections by age, Decade, themes, category were visualized. Also, the top 5 Theme and SubTheme, the top item by category and Projected revenue including the image were viaualized.

    c. Consequently, other pages were created to visualize the projections for each decade which included a brief history on that particular decade.

    d. In order to give supplementary information on the decades, AI tools and internet search engines were used to conduct researches.

**Insight.**
    a. Pre-90s, LEGOSET had a very poor run of Revenue but this ended with a high return at the beginning of the 90s.

    b. Sales and Revenues were limited to or expected from " zero age range" but this changed significantly in the 5th Decade.

    c. The idea of Godtfred Christiansen really proved that Lego has been utilizing the neccessity of creativity in children to improve the quality of their productions thus leading to an upward spiral of their global acceptance.
